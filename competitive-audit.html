                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;">Kahoot! is a very engaging app as it helps users learn by implementing questions on topics
into a fast-paced and competitive game where you compete with other players. It motivates users to get the correct answer with points scores, leaderboards 
and timers to quicken brain flow.(10/10)</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: orange; color:black;">Typing.com wouldnt be classified as the most engaging game, the user is provided with typing games to make it more fun to practice. It may motivate the 
user with providing small achievements and badges for completing lessons but it tends to be quite boring over-time. Consiting of constant
repitition which will involve the user to upkeep their motivation.(6/10)</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;">CodeSpark Academy is highly engaging, specifically for young kids as they learn basic coding through solving puzzles, playing games and challanges.
It allows creativity by encouraging users to create, complete daily challanges, and by providing a ot of visual feedback. However, the app is more so based on problem-solving and 
is not the best for tranistioning to text-based coding languages in the future. (8/10)</td>

                        <td>Progress tracking: How well does the app track the userâ€™s progress?</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;">Kahoot! focuses mainly on the present engagment rather than tracking progress long-term. The players recive instant feedback
on answers and rank players on leaderboards against others. However it lacks structured progress tracking besides actively acessing real-time scores as a report.(8/10)</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;">Typing.com does very well with keeping track of user progress by accurately tracking word counts and timers on lessons,
and they may review their reports on progress to reflect on accuracy and their overall speed to completion. However, the app does not suggest improvement on mistakes in depth to help
improve upon these. (9/10)</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: orange; color:black;">The app provides feedback and encourages unlocking levels, however there is very little tracking progress as it is soley focused on 
level completion without deep insight. There are no data trends to view overtime which disrupts learning and prevents the user to understand the level of their progression.(4/10)</td>

                        <td>User Experience: How user-friendly is the app?</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;">Kahoot! is very user-friendly as it is easy to use to everyone and consists of bright colours and it is easy to navigate through,
it is cross-platfromed and only requires a game PIN to enter a quizz game.(10/10)</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;">Typing.com is a very easy to use and simple app, displaying a very minimalistic design, lessons are structured and organised to keep the user focused
and on task. It also provides the user with adjusting difficulty to help practice at their level. There is howver a lack on visual acpects that make it less enganing. It is also very keyboard 
focused which makes it more difficult to work through mobile users. Therefore, the learning patterns are less effective.(7/10)</td>
                        <td style ="background-color: green; color:black;"> The app is very user-friendly as it focused on younger kids learning. It lacks requirement of reading and uses simple interface that is easy to naviagte for everyone.
It consists of bright styles and colours and easy access of levels. The only downside would be that its not advanced enough for older kids as its too simple and does not transition well
to text-basd code.(9/10)</td>
